# Project Brief

This project focuses on developing and maintaining custom tentacles for the OctoBot trading framework.

The goal is to build reusable, configurable, and high-performance tentacles (evaluators, strategies, trading modes, and services) that enable systematic crypto trading, especially on short timeframes and derivatives markets.

Core objectives:
- Create robust technical analysis evaluators and strategies.
- Support multi-timeframe and weighted signal logic.
- Ensure compatibility with OctoBot’s tentacle architecture and APIs.
- Prioritize clarity, determinism, and backtest/live consistency.
- Make tentacles easy to configure, extend, and debug.

The project targets algorithmic crypto traders who want transparent, modular, and customizable trading logic within the OctoBot ecosystem.
